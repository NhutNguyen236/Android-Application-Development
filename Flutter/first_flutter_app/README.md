# first_flutter_app 
A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started
### Installing Flutter on Windows
*Note that: this is an installation guideline but with Android Studio installed, if you do not have one, please have one* :blush:
* Step 1: Downloading Flutter SDK from Flutter mainstream (Link: <a>https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install</a>)
* Step 2: Extract the Flutter SDK in the folder that you want to put it in then you will receive a *flutter* folder
* Step 3: Add Flutter SDK to path by locating */bin* folder of Flutter SDK, mine is *D:\flutter\bin*

</p>

* Step 4: Update Android SDK for Flutter by using command line: <br>

```bash
flutter config --android-sdk <path-to-your-android-sdk-path>
```
In my case, it should be: <br>

```bash
flutter config --android-sdk D:\flutter\bin
```

* Step 5: Run *flutter doctor* to see eveything is OK or not

```bash
flutter doctor
```
Then you can expect that y'all about to have a screen like this one, even if it still has some warnings and unexpected errors but the rest of Flutter still works fine to me so yeah, I will figure the way out how to fix that

* Step 6: This could a minor one **but** it cannot be left behind. Adding Flutter plug-in to you Android Studio, without this one, nothing can be compiled.

* Step 6: Now everything should be ready, you can enjoy your Flutter now :grinning:
