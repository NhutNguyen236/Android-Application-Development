# Project Descryption

<p>
  I did use Relative_Layout to creat everything in this exercise and transfer data from main to second activity using Bundle
</p>

<p align = "center">
  Main Activity
</p>

<p align = "center">
  <img src = "https://github.com/NhutNguyen236/Android_Application_Development/blob/master/Screenshots/Lab02-01-relative1.png" width = "400px" height = "800px"/>
</p>


<p align = "center">
  Second Activity
</p>

<p align = "center">
  <img src = "https://github.com/NhutNguyen236/Android_Application_Development/blob/master/Screenshots/Lab02-01-relative2.png" width = "400px" height = "800px"/>
</p>
